SYSTEM IMPLEMENTAION
Security implementation is very important in almost every software project.
In this project, user authentication is placed, when the application run, a login screen will be displayed where user needs to enter his credentials to gain access to the system.
In this system there is login access for only authenticated persons only, like admin. This user has complete access to the system.
FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

The Current System can include many more enhancements. These are as Follows:
Buy from the card is the optional in this project.
There is no verification while buy from the card.
The Payment Gateway is not added in this project.
As mentioned earlier, the project is web based application. This will convert into
Android application which will enhance the project.
Hence, the current software would be updated in near future to overcome limitation as specified above.
